## CI is pinned

Every input to CI is pinned in the source (bats-lang/repository-prototype#269),
so a commit that passes keeps passing:

* The package has no dependencies, so it has no `bats.lock`.
* The compiler is the commit in `.github/bats-version`, read by every
  workflow that builds bats (and by the publish workflow).
* The package repository is fetched at the commit in
  `.github/repository-version`, so what the test packages under `tests/`
  lock (`bats lock --dev`) is pinned too.
* `publish.yml` and `relock-pins.yml` in bats-lang/repository-prototype are
  called by commit, never `@main`.

Pins move only through a reviewed pull request that runs the same CI. The
daily `relock.yml` (the shared `relock-pins.yml`) relocks against the
newest, moves the compiler and repository pins, pushes `relock/<date>`,
opens a pull request listing the old and new versions and dispatches
`check.yml` on it, so a breaking publish shows as a red relock pull
request and main stays green. GITHUB_TOKEN cannot change workflow files,
so without a `RELOCK_TOKEN` secret that pull request lists a workflow pin
that would move instead of moving it: move it in a pull request of its
own. A pull request that needs newer packages runs `bats lock
--repository <dir>` and commits `bats.lock` (and
`.github/repository-version`) with the change.
